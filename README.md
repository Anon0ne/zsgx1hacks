Record of attempted hacks on the ZS-GX1 IP Camera

For context, this is a cheap Pan Tilt IP Camera (supposedly 1080p) that for a time was available on Gearbest for around Â£12. I bought 2 in an attempt to hack them as the reason they are so cheap is due to them being locked to paid cloud services.

2017-10-22 - Update 3
* RTSP server user/pass - admin/admin - Presents a 1920x1080 12fps stream on rtsp://IPADDRESS/ (no audio)

2017-10-21 - Update 2
* home folder uploaded
* p2pcam.tar.gz is the interesting file - this gets extracted on boot and p2pcam is the camera software.

2017-10-21 - Update 1
* Photos of box and dismantled camera in the photo folder
* Initial process was to download the app via the QR code in the instructions, this gave it WIFI details to logon to, possibly this could be prevented using ethernet.
* Camera dismantled and serial pins found
* Boot output from serial dumped (uploaded)
* The serial interface auto-logs in as root - very useful, but I've been unable to find the root password
* Via serial interface you can add a new user - meaning you can then login via telnet with new user, or change the root password
```
passwd root
```
* /home/start.sh looks for /mnt/debug_cmd.sh which would be placed on a micro SD card - this should be the way to hack the camera.
* Due to the earlier "adduser" or "passwd root" not being persistent through reboots I added the following to debug_cmd.sh
```
(sleep 20 && echo "root:o.eyOMtPAPfbg:0:0:root:/root/:/bin/sh" > /etc/passwd )&
```
* The long sleep is required because the command has to be run after busybox has started - this updates the root password to "root"
* I made a quick attempt to upgrade busybox with a prebuilt binary but the autologin fails on serial - used debug_cmd.sh to copy new version over existing located at /bin/busybox - but having already updated the root password you can login over telnet
* nmap shows the following open ports
```
